# volatile
A password saver in .NET. Saves passwords inside the executable in AES256.

## What works?
Currently, everything **except exporting data** works. I thus don't recommend using it, since everytime you change your exe (update), saved data is lost.  
You can add, update and remove accounts, as well as seeing them.
